# SCAM  
## Selective Compliance Autosampling Manipulator  
I cannot continue with this project right now due to other priorities!

<p align="justify">
A 3 DOF SCARA style manipulator designed, built and programmed for automating the loading of the Corning 353072 96-well microplate.
This repository contains code for modelling SCAM forward and inverse kinematics.  
See individual folders for more information. See the `docs/` directory for more information.
